## Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Setting the scene**

A local online media company that publishes daily content on digital platforms is planning to release an article on **demographic structures and distribution of Singapore in 2024**.

## **About Data**

I will use the data for this task from the [Singapore Residents by Planning Area/Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024' dataset, published by the Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS)](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data)

## **My Task**

As the graphical editor of the media company, my task is to design and prepare up to **three** data visualisations to support an upcoming article on Singapore’s demographic structure and distribution in 2024.

## Getting started

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Load packages

Firstly, write below code chunk to install and check the R packages installed.

-   `tidyverse` → Core data wrangling & plotting (`readr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, etc.)

-   `gapminder` → Sample dataset & example pipeline for animated bubble plots.

-   `ggiraph` → Make ggplot2 charts interactive (tooltips, hover/click).

-   `plotly` → Convert plots into fully interactive JavaScript charts.

-   `patchwork` → Combine multiple ggplots into a single layout.

-   `DT` → Render data frames as interactive HTML tables.

-   `gganimate` → Animate ggplot2 visuals via transitions & easing.

-   `gifski` → Render gganimate output as a shareable GIF file.

```{r}

pacman::p_load(tidyverse,ggiraph,
               plotly, patchwork, 
               DT,gifski,
               gapminder,gganimate)
```

### Import data

```{r}

population_age_sex_2024 <- read_csv("respopagesex2024/respopagesex2024.csv")

```

### **Review the dataframe's structure**

```{r}
glimpse(population_age_sex_2024)

```

### Checking duplicate

```{r}
population_age_sex_2024[duplicated(population_age_sex_2024),]
```

## Filtering data for selected variables

| Variable Abbreviation | Variable Term | Variable Descrption |
|:-------------------|:------------------|---------------------------------|
| PA | Planning Area | These are the main geographical divisions used for planning and census purposes in Singapore. They are delineated by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). |
| SZ | Subzone | Each planning area is further divided into subzones, which are smaller areas typically focused around a specific activity or neighborhood center. For example, within the Singapore River planning area, subzones include Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, and Robertson Quay. |
| Age | Age in years | The age of individuals, measured in completed years. |
| Sex | Gender | Biological sex classification of the population group, recorded as “Males” or “Females.” |
| Pop | Population count | The total number of individuals in each age–sex group (or area) for the given year. |
| Time | Year | The calendar year to which the population data refers (e.g. 2024). |

## Insights {#sec-insights}

-   The 2024 pyramid reveals a broad central bulge (ages 30–44), reflecting Singapore’s large working-age cohorts.
-   Child and adolescent bands (0–19) are noticeably narrower, hinting at lower birth rates in recent years.
-   The sex ratio is near-balanced among younger ages, tilts to a modest female surplus in middle age (35–59), and flips to a male edge in the oldest cohorts (85+).

**Policy implications**\
- Workforce planning should account for the sizeable mid-career population.\
- A shrinking youth base may lead to future labour shortages and calls for strategies to bolster the next generation.

## EDA 2: Which Planning Areas(PA) are the most populous, and how is that population split by gender?

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(plotly)

pa_gender <- population_age_sex_2024 %>%
  filter(Time == 2024) %>%
  group_by(PA, Sex) %>%
  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = "drop")

top_pa_totals <- pa_gender %>%
  group_by(PA) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(Pop), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

plot_data <- pa_gender %>%
  filter(PA %in% top_pa_totals$PA) %>%
  mutate(PA = factor(PA, levels = top_pa_totals$PA))

plot_ly(
  data        = plot_data,
  x           = ~Pop,
  y           = ~PA,

    hovermode = "closest",

      categoryarray  = top_pa_totals$PA  
    ),

## Insights

-   **Tampines** and **Bedok** emerge as the two most populous PAs in 2024, each hosting nearly 280 000 residents, followed closely by Jurong West and Woodlands (\~260 000 – 270 000).\
-   Across all top ten areas, **male counts slightly exceed female** counts, with the largest gender gap in Tampines (\~10 000 more males).\
-   **Younger dormitory towns** like Punggol and Sengkang show narrower sex‐ratios (\~5 000–7 000 difference), hinting at a more balanced or family‐oriented population.\
-   Established estates—Tampines, Bedok, Jurong West—display both high density and a persistent male majority, possibly reflecting workforce demographics in these hubs.\
-   **Policy takeaway**: Resource planning (housing, transport, healthcare) should account for both the sheer volume in these top PAs and their modest but consistent male‐leaning imbalance.\

## EDA 3: Comparing Top 5 Subzones（SZ) by Young (25–35) vs. Elderly (70 +) Populations

library(forcats)
library(scales)

young_top5 <- population_age_sex_2024 %>%
  mutate(AgeNum = as.numeric(Age)) %>%
  filter(Time == 2024, AgeNum >= 25, AgeNum <= 35) %>%
  group_by(SZ) %>%
  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = "drop") %>%
  slice_max(Pop, n = 5) %>%
  mutate(SZ = fct_reorder(SZ, Pop))

old_top5 <- population_age_sex_2024 %>%
  mutate(AgeNum = as.numeric(Age)) %>%
  filter(Time == 2024, AgeNum >= 70) %>%
  group_by(SZ) %>%
  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = "drop") %>%
  slice_max(Pop, n = 5) %>%

## Insights

-   Tampines East leads both 25–35 and 70+ groups, indicating a broad, intergenerational base.\
-   Woodlands East, Yishun East, Tampines West and Yunnan dominate the 25–35 bracket, reflecting an influx of working-age families into these newer estates.\
-   Bedok North, Bedok South and Hong Kah feature in the 70+ top-5, highlighting higher elderly concentrations in these mature precincts.\
-   Tampines West appears in both lists, suggesting a more balanced age profile.\
-   These spatial patterns pinpoint where to prioritize youth services (childcare, schools) versus eldercare resources (healthcare, senior centers).\
-   Planners can leverage this nuanced insight to allocate infrastructure and social programs more effectively.\

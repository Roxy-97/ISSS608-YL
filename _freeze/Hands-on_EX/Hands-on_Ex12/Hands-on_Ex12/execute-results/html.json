Like choropleth maps, you can create classed or unclassed versions of these maps. The classed ones are known as range-graded or graduated symbols, and the unclassed are called proportional symbols, where the area of the symbols are proportional to the values of the attribute being mapped. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create a proportional symbol map showing the number of wins by Singapore Pools’ outlets using an R package called **tmap**.\n\n## **12.1.1 Learning outcome**\n\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will acquire the following skills by using appropriate R packages:\n\n-   To import an aspatial data file into R.\n\n-   To convert it into simple point feature data frame and at the same time, to assign an appropriate projection reference to the newly create simple point feature data frame.\n\n-   To plot interactive proportional symbol maps.\n\n# **12.2 Getting Started**\n\nBefore we get started, we need to ensure that **tmap** package of R and other related R packages have been installed and loaded into R.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# **12.3 Geospatial Data Wrangling**\n\n## **12.3.1 The data**\n\nThe data set use for this hands-on exercise is called *SGPools_svy21*. The data is in csv file format.\n\nFigure below shows the first 15 records of SGPools_svy21.csv. It consists of seven columns. The XCOORD and YCOORD columns are the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of SingPools outlets and branches. They are in [Singapore SVY21 Projected Coordinates System](https://www.sla.gov.sg/sirent/CoordinateSystems.aspx).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsgpools <- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/SGPools_svy21.csv\")\n```\n:::\n",
